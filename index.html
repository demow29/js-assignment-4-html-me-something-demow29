         <h1>Thrift Shop Art Collection</h1>
      </header>
      <p>Over the years, I have collected many artifacts from thrift shops. These pieces are less 
         than extraordinary. I have little context on the artist and time these works were concieved. These works 
         hang on my bedroom wall with no inherent sentiment attached to them. If I had to give advice to an amphibious 
         creature from another planet on how to be human, I would tell them to start by forming an uncontrived 
         appreciation literally anything. </p>
